            <h2>Recap VCR</h2>
            <p>My VCR displays color bars horizontally across the screen while playing back. I suspect the caps are just old and should be replaced. I will likely make a video about it when I tackle that.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>I am planning to add alt text to every image on this site. Screen readers should be able to speak the alt text, and I'd like for the visually impaired to be able to know what my photos are of!</p>

            <h2>Flood car</h2>
            <p>I bought a car that was under water in a big flood we had here towards the beginning of summer. It runs, but it doesn't run right. I will post an update about it once it runs and drives.</p>

            <h2>Old browser compatibility</h2>
            <p>This site doesn't display very well on my black and white macs. I plan on adding a parameter to the CSS to allow it to be displayed in a more fitting way on the low-res black and white screens. </p>
