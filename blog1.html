                <h2>Height On The Wall</h2>
                <p>April 25, 2024</p>
                <img src="images/blog1/height.png" alt="height of us and our friends measured against the wall.">
                <p>When David, Badger and I did <s>LSD</s>  we stood next to each other and realized we are all about the same height. We then started measuring our friends on the wall. We are moving May 1st, so we won't have this anymore. I'm going to start documenting things. History is happening right now, and the mundane will be lost if someone doesn't document it.</p>
